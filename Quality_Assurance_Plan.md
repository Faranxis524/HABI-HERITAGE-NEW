# Quality Assurance Plan for Habi Heritage

## A. INTRODUCTION
- **Description**: Overview of the QA plan, project context, and quality goals.
- **Example**: "This plan outlines the quality assurance processes, standards, and responsibilities for the Habi Heritage web application to ensure reliability, performance, security, and user satisfaction in cultural heritage promotion."

## B. OBJECTIVES OF QUALITY ASSURANCE
- **Description**: Defines what the QA plan aims to achieve.
- **Example**:
  - Ensure software meets customer requirements and cultural heritage standards.
  - Prevent defects through continuous testing, reviews, and best practices.
  - Maintain compliance with industry standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010 for software quality).

## C. SCOPE OF QUALITY ASSURANCE
- **Description**: Specifies which aspects of quality are covered.
- **Example**: "Covers functional correctness, usability, performance, reliability, maintainability, security, and accessibility for cultural content."

## D. QUALITY STANDARDS AND METRICS
- **Description**: Defines the standards and measurable indicators of quality.
- **Example**:
  - Standards: IEEE 829 for test documentation, ISO 9001 for process quality, WCAG for accessibility.
  - Metrics:
    - Defect density (defects per 1,000 lines of code).
    - Test coverage (percentage of requirements tested, target: 90%).
    - Mean time to failure (MTTF) for system reliability.

## E. QUALITY ASSURANCE ACTIVITIES
- **Description**: Lists the QA methods and activities to ensure quality.
- **Example**:
  - Process QA: Code reviews, inspections, pair programming.
  - Product QA: Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
  - Automation QA: Automated regression testing using Jest and Selenium.

## F. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
- **Description**: Defines the QA team's responsibilities.
- **Example**:
  - QA Manager: Oversees QA process and metrics.
  - Test Engineers: Write and execute test cases, perform exploratory testing.
  - Developers: Perform unit testing, code reviews, and fix defects.
  - End-users/Clients: Participate in User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and provide feedback.

## G. TEST PLAN REFERENCE
- **Description**: Links the QA plan to the detailed test plan.
- **Example**: "QA activities will follow the test plan (document TP-HABI-01), covering functional, usability, performance, security, and accessibility testing."

## H. DEFECT MANAGEMENT
- **Description**: Defines how defects will be logged, tracked, and resolved.
- **Example**:
  - Tools: Jira for tracking.
  - Severity Levels: Critical (system down), Major (feature broken), Minor (cosmetic issues).
  - Process: Detect → Log → Assign → Fix → Retest → Close.

## I. QUALITY CONTROL (QC) PROCEDURES
- **Description**: Activities to verify outputs meet quality requirements.
- **Example**:
  - Review code against coding standards (e.g., PSR for PHP, ESLint for JavaScript).
  - Conduct peer reviews and walkthroughs.
  - Perform regression testing before each release.

## J. Configuration Management
- **Description**: Ensures all versions and changes are controlled.

- **Example**: "Git will be used for version control with a branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches), code review policies, and automated CI/CD pipelines."

## K. TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
- **Description**: Lists QA tools to be used.
- **Example**:
  - Static Analysis: SonarQube for code quality checks.
  - Automated Testing: Jest for unit tests, Selenium for UI tests, Postman for API tests.
  - CI/CD Integration: Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests.

## L. RISK MANAGEMENT IN QA
- **Description**: Identifies risks to software quality and mitigation strategies.
- **Example**:
  - Risk: Incomplete test coverage → Mitigation: Use coverage tools and prioritize critical paths.
  - Risk: Limited testing devices → Mitigation: Use cloud-based test environments like BrowserStack.

## M. MONITORING AND REPORTING
- **Description**: Defines how QA progress and quality metrics will be tracked and reported.
- **Example**: "Weekly QA reports including test execution status, defect trends, quality metrics, and recommendations for improvements."

## N. APPROVAL AND SIGN-OFF
- **Description**: Defines who approves the QA plan and test results.
- **Example**: "Project Manager, QA Lead, and Client Representative."
