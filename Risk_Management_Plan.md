# Risk Management Plan for Habi Heritage

## A. INTRODUCTION
- **Description**: Provides an overview of risk management objectives and scope.
- **Example**: "This plan outlines the process for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks associated with the development of the Habi Heritage web application, a platform for cultural heritage preservation."

## B. OBJECTIVES OF RISK MANAGEMENT
- **Description**: Explains why risk management is being performed.
- **Example**:
  - Minimize potential project delays due to unforeseen issues.
  - Control cost overruns from scope changes or resource shortages.
  - Ensure software reliability and quality to meet user expectations.

## C. SCOPE OF RISK MANAGEMENT
- **Description**: Defines which risks will be considered (technical, organizational, external).
- **Example**: "Covers risks related to project schedule, cost, resources, technology integration, security, and compliance with cultural heritage standards."

## D. RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH
- **Description**: Explains the methodology or framework used.
- **Example**: "Risks will be identified during planning and sprint reviews, tracked throughout execution using a risk register. Techniques include brainstorming sessions, expert judgment, and SWOT analysis."

## E. RISK IDENTIFICATION
- **Description**: Process of identifying risks that may affect the project.
- **Example**:
  - Technical: API integration failures, software bugs, database performance issues.
  - Organizational: Team member turnover, unclear requirements, communication gaps.
  - External: Regulatory changes in data privacy, vendor delays for payment gateways, cultural sensitivity issues.

## F. RISK ANALYSIS
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Ranking risks based on probability and impact (High/Medium/Low).
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Estimating numerical impact (time lost, cost added).
- **Example**:
  - Risk: Payment gateway integration failure → Probability: Medium → Impact: High (potential loss of $10,000 in development costs).

## G. RISK RESPONSE PLANNING
- **Description**: Defines strategies to address risks.
- **Strategies**:
  - Avoidance: Change the project plan to eliminate risk.
  - Mitigation: Reduce probability/impact.
  - Transfer: Shift responsibility (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).
  - Acceptance: Acknowledge and monitor the risk.
- **Example**:
  - Risk: Key developer resigns → Mitigation: Maintain backup developers, document code thoroughly, use pair programming.

## H. RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL
- **Description**: Continuous process of tracking risks, reviewing triggers, and updating responses.
- **Example**: "Weekly risk review meetings, updates to the risk register, and logging of new risks as they are discovered during development."

## I. RISK REGISTER
- **Description**: Central document tracking risks, owners, probability, impact, and responses.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Owner | Response Strategy | Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| R1 | Delay in requirements gathering | High | High | Project Manager | Mitigation: Use agile iterations | Open |
| R2 | Payment API failure | Medium | High | Lead Developer | Mitigation: Use mock API for testing | Open |
| R3 | Budget overrun | Low | High | Finance Lead | Acceptance + monitoring | Open |
| R4 | Key developer turnover | Medium | Medium | HR Manager | Mitigation: Cross-training and documentation | Open |
| R5 | Database performance issues | Medium | High | Database Admin | Mitigation: Optimize queries and use caching | Open |
| R6 | Security vulnerabilities in payment processing | High | High | Security Lead | Mitigation: Regular audits and encryption | Open |
| R7 | Cultural content copyright infringement | Low | High | Legal Advisor | Avoidance: Obtain permissions and legal review | Open |
| R8 | Third-party vendor delays (e.g., hosting) | Medium | Medium | Project Manager | Transfer: Use alternative vendors | Open |

## J. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
- **Description**: Defines team members' responsibilities in risk management.
- **Example**:
  - Project Manager: Oversees the risk process and facilitates reviews.
  - QA Lead: Identifies quality-related risks.
  - Developers: Report technical risks and implement mitigations.
  - Stakeholders: Provide input on external risks.

## K. Tools and Techniques
- **Description**: Tools used for risk tracking and management.
- **Example**: "Jira for risk tracking, MS Project for schedule impact analysis, risk matrix charts for visualization."

## L. Approval and Sign-off
- **Description**: Lists stakeholders who must approve the RMP.
- **Example**: "Project Manager, Client Representative, Risk Officer."
