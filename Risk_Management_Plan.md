# Risk Management Plan for Habi Heritage

## A. INTRODUCTION
This plan outlines the process for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks associated with the development of the Habi Heritage web application, a platform for cultural heritage preservation. It follows the risk management process including identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring as per ISO 31000 standards.

## B. OBJECTIVES OF RISK MANAGEMENT
- Minimize potential project delays due to unforeseen issues.
- Control cost overruns from scope changes or resource shortages.
- Ensure software reliability and quality to meet user expectations.
- Protect resources such as time, money, and human capital.
- Increase the chance of success by preparing for uncertainties.

## C. SCOPE OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Covers risks related to project schedule, cost, resources, technology integration, security, and compliance with cultural heritage standards. This includes technical risks like software bugs, organizational risks such as team turnover, and external risks including regulatory changes.

## D. RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Risks will be identified during planning and sprint reviews, tracked throughout execution using a risk register. Techniques include brainstorming sessions, expert judgment, SWOT analysis, and checklists. The process involves continuous monitoring, stakeholder involvement, and integration with project management activities.

## E. RISK IDENTIFICATION
- Technical: API integration failures, software bugs, database performance issues, server downtime.
- Organizational: Team member turnover, unclear requirements, communication gaps, resource shortages.
- External: Regulatory changes in data privacy, vendor delays for payment gateways, cultural sensitivity issues, natural disasters affecting operations.

## F. RISK ANALYSIS
- Qualitative Analysis: Ranking risks based on probability and impact (High/Medium/Low) using a risk probability-impact matrix.
- Quantitative Analysis: Estimating numerical impact (time lost, cost added) using Expected Monetary Value (EMV) calculations.
- Risk: Payment gateway integration failure → Probability: Medium → Impact: High (potential loss of $10,000 in development costs).

## G. RISK RESPONSE PLANNING
- Strategies:
  - Avoidance: Change the project plan to eliminate risk.
  - Mitigation: Reduce probability/impact.
  - Transfer: Shift responsibility (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).
  - Acceptance: Acknowledge and monitor the risk.
- Risk: Key developer resigns → Mitigation: Maintain backup developers, document code thoroughly, use pair programming.

## H. RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL
Weekly risk review meetings, updates to the risk register, and logging of new risks as they are discovered during development. This includes tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, evaluating response effectiveness, and conducting risk audits.

## I. RISK REGISTER

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Owner | Response Strategy | Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| R1 | Delay in requirements gathering | High | High | Project Manager | Mitigation: Use agile iterations | Open |
| R2 | Payment API failure | Medium | High | Lead Developer | Mitigation: Use mock API for testing | Open |

| R7 | Cultural content copyright infringement | Low | High | Legal Advisor | Avoidance: Obtain permissions and legal review | Open |
| R8 | Third-party vendor delays (e.g., hosting) | Medium | Medium | Project Manager | Transfer: Use alternative vendors | Open |
| R9 | Scope creep from additional features | Medium | High | Project Manager | Mitigation: Strict change control process | Open |
| R10 | Data privacy compliance issues | High | High | Compliance Officer | Mitigation: Regular audits and legal consultation | Open |

## J. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
- Project Manager: Oversees risk process, facilitates reviews, and ensures stakeholder involvement.
- QA Lead: Identifies quality-related risks and monitors testing risks.
- Developers: Report technical risks and implement mitigations.
- Stakeholders: Provide input on external risks and participate in risk discussions.

## K. Tools and Techniques
Jira for risk tracking, MS Project for schedule impact analysis, risk matrix charts for visualization, and brainstorming sessions for identification.

## L. Approval and Sign-off
Project Manager, Client Representative, Risk Officer.
